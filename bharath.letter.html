<p>How have you been?I hope you are doing good.What about 
    your family?I hope they are also doing great!Well, I'm writing this
    letter to ask you why you are not coming to college for the last four
    days </p>
<p>Is everything stable? What's the matter? You are not in college for 
   the last 4 days. I hope you don't have any illness. The class teacher
   wass asking about you. As you know there was practical yesterday 
   and you missed that too.</p>
<p>However,the teacher has told us that he will explain that practical
    once more.He has scheduled it for Monday. I hope till then you will 
    come. And if you are not well then please inform me about your 
    health.I'm waiting for your reply.</p>
